# Project3: GeoWeb APP

ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

## Overview:
This website is an assignment for the 3rd lab (Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies). This lab is mainly dependent on the previous lab, lab 2, in all aspects of the web structure except adding a new map layer to the web page by utilizing Mapbox studio editor. The new layer is completely designed by this editor, including adding traffic incidents dataset to the map which is represented by a heatmap on the map. Users can toggle on/off between two layers, my published layer and the original layer that was used in the previous lab. Moreover, the loading indicator (e.g. the indicator that is used in youtube videos) is integrated with the web page to indicate that system is searching for the candidate markers. 

## System requirement:
- Any platform you like such as Windows, Linux, and so on. 
- Use any browsers (Firefox, Google Chrome,...) to display the html pages. 
- Python 3.6 or higher

## Libraries required to install:
- Flask 
- requests <br>
You can find both libraries in the `requirements.txt` and install them by running this command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal window.

## Tools and Resources are used:
- HTML 5
- CSS
- Python flask 
- Javascript
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [GeoJSON](https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/)
- [Open Calgary API dataset](https://data.calgary.ca/Business-and-Economic-Activity/Building-Permits/c2es-76ed)
- [Mapbox Studio Editor](https://studio.mapbox.com/)
- [Traffic Incidents dataset](https://data.calgary.ca/Transportation-Transit/Traffic-Incidents-Archive-2017/himp-urp7/data)

## The Map Configuration in Mapbox Studio:
- Dataset: [Traffic Incidents dataset](https://data.calgary.ca/Transportation-Transit/Traffic-Incidents-Archive-2017/himp-urp7/data) is converted to vector tiles to be used in the map.
- Style: "basic" style and some useless layers is removed to optimize the map such as "satellite layer". 
- Heatmap: represents the traffic dataset, which red circle represents the highest density of traffic incident at its location on the map, but the outer blue circle represents the lowest density of the traffic. and the heat map configuration are:
    - Radius of heatmap circle: 20 px
    - Opasity: 0.61
 - Building:

## How to use the webpage:
* After installing all libraries required in your environment, run `application.py` in any IDE you like.
* You will find a line in the console `Running on <server link>` where `<server link>` is the link of the server of the flask is working on. In my case, the server link is `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. 
* Copy the server link and paste it in the link box of any browser you like to go to the website.

* Looking closely at the image above, you can see a map of the city of Calgary. Above it, a search box is located that is utilized to search for building permits by date range. 
* Choose any date range you want from the date range picker widget, then, click on the **Apply** button on this widget. After that, Click on the **Search** button, as you see below.

![search](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26576895/109386591-476ba880-7904-11eb-99f0-56a40fe3e6b4.JPG)

* After searching, you will find markers and clusters of building permits in Calgary, where a marker represents a single building permit, but the cluster represents the group of the neighboring markers (building permits).

* By clicking on any cluster, the map will zoom in automatically to get the neighboring markers or other clusters. if you click on any new cluster that is created, the map will zoom in to get other markers and clusters and so on till you get your desired marker. 
* If you click on any marker, you will get the pop content message that includes all information about building permits, including `issueddate`, `workclassgroup`, `contractorname`, `communityname` and `originaladdress`, as you see below.

![popcontent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26576895/109387046-8e0ed200-7907-11eb-8677-23f57ff4727a.JPG)

* Sometimes, some markers are overlapping, i.e., multiple building permits located at the same location. Therefore, I handled it by using Leaflet Plug-in, in which all overlapping markers are integrated together in a single marker and if you click on this marker, you will get all overlapping markers inside it, as you see in the image below. 

![overlapping_markers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26576895/109388432-a8e54480-790f-11eb-9e23-a04ece1e500d.JPG)

* Finally, if you'd like to get another building permits in another date range, choose the new date range and click on **search** again and you will find that the map is refreshed and display the new matching result.

## whatâ€™s contained in each file:
- `application.py`: is responsible for python flask coding and getting JSON data from Open Calgary API dataset and then passes it to the `building_permit_search.html` file.
- `templates/building_permit_search.html`: has the structure of the webpage and all links of Leaflet code.   
- `static/styles/building_permit_search.css`: this is a specified style sheet file for `building_permit_search.html` file.
- `static/js/building_permit_search.js`: creating Leaflet map and date range widget algorithm are located in this file.
